# DinoAI is based on: https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5

If you are here just for testing you can use my Dino.model. I've trained Dino for only 5 games but it's enough to make relatively high scores.

If you want to make your own model, first open chrome://Dino and hit Windows Key + Left Arrow (this is important since it takes screenshots of the game) then, run collect_data.py and play the game.(only use arrow keys)

when you finished balance your data with balance_data.py after that start training your model with train_model.py

Now you can start testing your model! Just open dino tab again and click test_model.py
